 •How to compile and run your program:
 -In Game class, once you click the run program button, you will be prompted player white will be prompted a format to input
coordinates in which they will choose a space containing a piece to move. After white inputs valid coordinates, it will
switch and prompt black's turn. Once a King is captured, the game is over and the program will indicate who won.

 •Any assumptions:
 -The program will run properly, under the assumption that the user will type in the coordinates EXACTLY as prompted
format no extra spaces or anything when asked for user input. Same goes for the pawn promotion, assuming that the user
will have capitalization and correct spelling, along with choosing a valid option. Otherwise, this chess game is a
simple version of the real game so moves such as "Check" and "Checkmate" do not exist.

 •Additional features that you implemented (if applicable):
 -None.

 •Any known bugs or defects in the program:
 None.
